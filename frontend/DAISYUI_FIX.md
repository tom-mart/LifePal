# DaisyUI Styling Fix

## Root Cause
**DaisyUI v5.1.26 has breaking changes and wasn't generating CSS properly with Next.js 15.**

## Solution
Downgraded to **daisyUI v4.12.24** (the version used in your working Vite example).

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated package.json
- Moved `daisyui` from `dependencies` to `devDependencies`
- Changed version from `^5.1.26` to `^4.12.24`

### 2. Verified Configuration
- âœ… `tailwind.config.js` - Correct (CommonJS format)
- âœ… `postcss.config.js` - Correct (CommonJS format)
- âœ… Tailwind CSS v3.4.17 - Compatible with daisyUI v4

### 3. Cleaned Build Cache
- Removed `.next` directory
- Removed test output files

## Verification
```bash
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/app/globals.css -o ./test-output.css
```

Output confirmed:
```
ðŸŒ¼   daisyUI 4.12.24
â”œâ”€ âœ”ï¸Ž 32 themes added
```

- âœ… `.btn-primary` classes generated (8 instances)
- âœ… `[data-theme=dark]` selectors present
- âœ… All 32 themes included

## Next Steps

**Restart the dev server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

The app should now have:
- âœ… Full daisyUI styling (buttons, cards, inputs, etc.)
- âœ… All 32 color themes working
- âœ… Theme switcher functional
- âœ… Proper colors and components

## Why This Happened

DaisyUI v5 was a major version with breaking changes:
- Different plugin architecture
- Changed CSS generation
- Incompatibility with certain build tools

Your working Vite example used v4, which is stable and well-tested with Tailwind CSS v3.
